🧪 How You Will Solve ANY DSA Problem (Golden Framework)
When you see a problem:
Step 1️⃣ Understand the Problem
Ask:
What is given?
What is asked?
Example input/output?

Step 2️⃣ Brute Force (Even if slow)
Think simplest solution
Ignore performance for now

Step 3️⃣ Optimize
Can I reduce loops?
Can I use a data structure?

Step 4️⃣ Code Cleanly
Write readable Python
Test with examples
This is how toppers think.

🧠 PART 1: How to THINK (This is the most important skill)

Whenever you see any DSA problem, follow this 4-step thinking framework:
🔹 STEP 1: What is GIVEN?
An array? size?
Any rules? (like permutation, sorted, duplicates?)

🔹 STEP 2: What is ASKED?
Return a number?
Return an array?
Modify in-place?

🔹 STEP 3: Manual Example (MANDATORY)
Take a small input
Solve it by hand
Observe the pattern

🔹 STEP 4: Convert Pattern → Code
Loop?
Index?
Extra array?
